# About
This is a native BlueMap addon that aims to add a renderer for each (vanilla) entity.
This means that when bluemap renders your map, it will also show entities where they are stored in the world-files at the time of rendering.  
Note that the entities will be static. They will not move around. They will only be updated when bluemap
renders the entities map-tile again.

# Usage
Download the `BlueMapEntities.jar` from the releases and place it in the `packs` folder next to your
bluemap-configs. You will need to purge/re-render the map to see the entities appear.
